### 🧪 Experimental Approach
This project was implemented using **v0**, an experimental AI-powered tool designed for fast UI component generation. It enabled quick iterations and streamlined the prototyping process, making it an excellent choice for MVP development.

As part of this project, I experimented with **vibe coding**, an intuitive and flexible approach to development. Instead of rigid planning, I focused on rapid experimentation and dynamic UI refinements, allowing for a more organic and efficient workflow. 🚀
